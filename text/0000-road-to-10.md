# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Volta 1.0 is on the horizon and we are working hard to finish the last few features needed before release! The remaining work on the path to Volta 1.0 is centered around making Volta both unobtrusive and scalable to teams of any size.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The 1.0 release of Volta means more than, "we implemented some high-impact functionality and finally closed some long-standing issues." From the beginning, Volta was built to empower engineers and engineering teams to build amazing JS applications without having to worry about their environment or tooling. For individual engineers, Volta unobtrusively makes sure your tooling is aligned with the rest of your team, allowing you to stay focused on your work. For engineering teams, Volta allows you to manage your infrastructure decision-making centrally without slowing down individual team members. When the team decides to change versions of Node, for example, that doesn't require explicit effort on the part of each developer. With version 1.0, we believe Volta delivers on the promise of making tool management disappear.

Features that are outstanding for Volta 1.0:

## Upgrades

Implement a method for updating Volta, so that users can easily stay up-to-date. See https://github.com/volta-cli/rfcs/pull/37 for a more in-depth discussion of this feature.

## `npm link` / `yarn link`

When developing and testing the interaction of Node packages, `npm link` / `yarn link` are often used to allow one project to depend on a local version of another project. Unfortunately, the current behavior with Volta is unspecified. It works if you use `yarn link` and both projects are using the exact same version of Yarn. We should work out the story so that users can `link` between projects that use completely different Node / Yarn versions. See https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/issues/56

## Monorepos / Yarn Workspaces

Currently, Volta only looks at the first `package.json` it finds as the root of a project and stops looking at that point. This works for single-project repositories, but for monorepos (including with Yarn workspaces), it would make sense to support pinning Node / Yarn at a higher level. We should allow some method of specifying that a project inherits its platform from a different `package.json` to better support that workflow. See https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/issues/378

## Installing / Pinning npm (Complete)

We currently don't support Pinning or Installing a different version of `npm` than comes bundled with Node. This can be an issue at times, because some versions of Node shipped with a broken `npm`, forcing users to upgrade their Node if they want to change `npm` versions. Since we support pinning Yarn independent of the Node version, we should do the same for npm. See https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/issues/292

## Run Command (Complete)

For advanced or debugging use-cases, we should support a `volta run` command that allows users to specify the versions of Node, npm, and Yarn to use at the command line. This will allow users to override the platform detected by Volta, in cases where they explicitly want to pick a different version of Node. See https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/issues/546

## Yarn 2.0 / Plug'n'Play

Yarn recently released version 2.0, which comes with a number of structural changes to how Yarn works. The largest of those changes is that Yarn Plug'n'Play is the behavior by default, so we will need to ensure support for that in order to make Yarn 2.0 work as expected with Volta. See https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/issues/651

## Documentation

As part of working towards 1.0, we should do a pass on our documentation and make sure that everything is up-to-date and accurate. We should also make sure that there aren't any major features that are missing documentation. This will improve the onboarding experience and allow new users to more easily discover how they can use Volta.

## Miscellaneous Polish

There are a few issues that are relatively small on their own, but combined represent a significant amount of work. Each of them represents polish that will make Volta more delightful to use. For example (not an exhaustive list):

## Shared Global Installs

A few Node tools (e.g. `yeoman` and `ts-node`) rely on global installs of packages that can be `require()`d in themselves, in order to allow for peer-dependencies or plugin-style architectures. Those projects don't currently work under Volta, since each tool installed with `volta install` is sandboxed and called without knowledge of the other tools. Additionally, there is a class of tools that don't use `require()`, but instead call out to other global tools directly, which expect a shared environment. We could support these use-cases in 1.0, however they seem to be relatively limited and not wide-spread. Given that the impact is lower since most tools don't operate in this manner, it seems reasonable that we don't require a fix as part of Volta 1.0.

- Are there any other issues / features that are important enough to be necessary for the 1.0 release?
