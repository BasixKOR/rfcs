# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Volta 1.0 is on the horizon and we are working hard to finish the last few features needed before release! The remaining work on the path to Volta 1.0 is centered around making Volta both unobtrusive and scalable to teams of any size.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The 1.0 release of Volta means more than, "we implemented some high-impact functionality and finally closed some long-standing issues." From the beginning, Volta was built to empower engineers and engineering teams to build amazing JS applications without having to worry about their environment or tooling. For individual engineers, Volta unobtrusively makes sure your tooling is aligned with the rest of your team, allowing you to stay focused on your work. For engineering teams, Volta allows you to manage your infrastructure decision-making centrally without slowing down individual team members. When the team decides to change versions of Node, for example, that doesn't require explicit effort on the part of each developer. With version 1.0, we believe Volta delivers on the promise of making tool management disappear.

Features that are outstanding for Volta 1.0:

## pnpm Support

Currently, Volta only supports npm and Yarn for package managers, as they are the two most popular. [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) is a relative newcomer to the space, however it is growing in adoption and we have received multiple requests to support it within Volta.

## `npm update -g` / `yarn global upgrade`

With the changes to support installing packages directly with `npm install -g` or `yarn global add`, we almost have full support for global operations. However, one area that is missing is the global upgrade command, which allows you to upgrade some or all of your global packages. We should correctly intercept that command and set the environment up to correctly upgrade packages within Volta's model.

## `npm link` / `yarn link`

When developing and testing the interaction of Node packages, `npm link` / `yarn link` are often used to allow one project to depend on a local version of another project. Unfortunately, the current behavior with Volta is unspecified. It works if you use `yarn link` and both projects are using the exact same version of Yarn. We should work out the story so that users can `link` between projects that use completely different Node / Yarn versions. See https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/issues/56

## Signed Installer

As part of moving to 1.0, we should acquire a code signing certificate so that we can digitally sign the Windows installer (and any future installers we wind up wanting to create). This is complicated a bit by the fact that there don't seem to be any certificate authorities that support open-source organizations for code signing, only individuals or companies.

## Documentation

We should do a pass on our documentation and make sure that everything is up-to-date and accurate. We should also make sure that there aren't any major features that are missing documentation. This will improve the onboarding experience and allow new users to more easily discover how they can use Volta.

# Timeline
[timeline]: #timeline

Given the set of outstanding features, the target for 1.0 is to have a release candidate available by Wednesday, December 16. Then, assuming there are no major problems found, the official release would come on Monday, December 21.

# Critique

## Yarn 2.0 / Plug'n'Play

Yarn recently released version 2.0, which comes with a number of structural changes to how Yarn works. The largest of those changes is that Yarn Plug'n'Play is the behavior by default, so to support Yarn 2.0, we would need to also support Yarn Plug'n'Play. However, Yarn Plug'n'Play itself appears to have a number of adoption issues and isn't widely used. Similarly, the transition to Yarn 2.0 has been limited within the community, so there doesn't appear to be a pressing need to support these features. Finally, we should be able to make internal changes to support Yarn 2.0 / PnP without anything that would be considered a breaking change, so it's something we can look to implement after 1.0, after the behavior stabilizes and adoption grows.

## Apple Silicon Support

The new Apple processors are available in laptops and showing lots of promise. Though we should support native builds on those processors, currently Volta works correctly under Rosetta 2, so this isn't a blocker for a 1.0 release. When we do add support, we also need to take into account that we may need to fall back to downloading x64 versions of Node on Apple devices, since there may not be native builds available for older versions of Node.

- Are there any other issues / features that are important enough to be necessary for the 1.0 release?
