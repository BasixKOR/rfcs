# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Change all version-specifying commands to use the `<tool>[@<version>]` syntax from `npm install`, `yarn add`, and `npx <package command>`.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Users may regularly want to add multiple tools to their toolchain at the same time. They are also accustomed to being able to install multiple dependencies simultaneously with the `npm install` or `yarn add` commands, both in a package and globally.

- **Local installs:**

    ```sh
    npm install ember-cli@3.9.1 typescript@3
    ```
    
    ```sh
    yarn global ember-cli@3.9.1 typescript@3
    ```

- **Global installs:**

    ```sh
    npm install --global ember-cli@3.9.1 typescript@3
    ```
    
    ```sh
    yarn global add ember-cli@3.9.1 typescript@3
    ```

Notion currently does not support this, requiring individual invocations for each tool:

- **User toolchain:**

    ```sh
    notion install ember-cli 3.9.1
    notion install typescript 3
    ```

- **Project toolchain:**

    ```sh
    notion pin ember-cli 3.9.1
    notion pin typescript 3
    ```

- **Tool retrieval:**

    ```sh
    notion fetch ember-cli 3.9.1
    notion fetch typescript 3
    ```

This is a surprising difference for users coming from `npm` or `yarn`. Switching over to use the same invocation as the existing tools will make adoption smoother and less surprising.

# Pedagogy
[pedagogy]: #pedagogy

Installation, fetching, and pinning function much as they do today, with two changes:

- The tool + version combination is now a single string, in the format `tool[@<version>]`. That is, a user may supply a tool with its name only, e.g. `node`, or with a specific version using the `@` to separate the name from the version, e.g. `node@10`, `node@10.5`, `node@10.5.2`, or `node@latest`.

- The invocations now allow multiple tool + version combinations, each of the format specified above. For example, a user may simultaneously pin a Node and a Yarn version (with any combination of the version specifier, or none at all):

  ```sh
  notion install node@10.5 yarn
  ```

## Explanation for Users

### Current Node users

There are two broad sets of current Node users: those not using a Node version management tool, and those using an existing tool like `nvm`, `nodenv`, or `nvm-windows`.

Current Node users who are not using a Node version management tool should find this a simplification: it matches what npm, npx, and Yarn do.

Current Node users using existing tools will find this to be different from their experience:

- `nvm` uses `nvm install <version>`
- `nodenv` uses `nodenv install <version>`
- `nvm-windows` uses `nvm install <version> [arch]` (where `[arch]` allows users to specify 32-bit or 64-bit builds)

Although we are breaking with these tools, all of them are responsible to manage *only* the Node version, *not* other tools. Notion's purview extends to other tools and therefore overlaps more with the behavior expected from invoking `npm` or `yarn`.

### New Node users

New Node users may have a wide variety of different expectations for adding a version of a tool:

- RubyGems: `gem install <gem name> [-v|--version <version>]`

- Bundler: `bundle add <gem name> [--version=<version>]`

- Nuget: `nuget install <package> [-Version <version>]`

- Paket: `paket add <package> [--version <version spec>]`

- `dotnet`: `dotnet tool install <PACKAGE_NAME> <-g|--global> [--version]`

- Cargo: `cargo install crate [--version <version>]`

- `cargo-edit`: `cargo add <package>[@<version>]...`

Of these, only `cargo-edit` allows adding multiple packages simultaneously; it does so with the same interface as `npm` and `yarn` and proposed here.

## Installing, fetchin, or pinning a single tool

Managing a tool with its default version is unchanged.

| Original                  | Proposed                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `notion install node`     | `notion install node`     |
| `notion pin yarn`         | `notion pin yarn`         |
| `notion fetch typescript` | `notion fetch typescript` |

Managing a tool at a specific version, at any level of granularity, now uses `@` to separate the tool name from its version.

| Original                     | Proposed                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `notion install node latest` | `notion install node@latest` |
| `notion pin node 10`         | `notion pin node@10`         |
| `notion fetch node 10.5`     | `notion fetch node@10.5`     |

This also works for shorthands (currently `latest`, conceivably also tags like `next` or `lts` in the future):

| Original                 | Proposed                  | Status      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| `notion pin node latest` | `notion pin node@latest` | current      |
| `notion pin node lts`    | `notion pin node@lts`    | current      |
| `notion pin node next`   | `notion pin node@next`   | hypothetical |

## Installing, fetching, or pinning multiple tools

Previously, installing multiple tools required invoking Notion multiple times. Now, it may be invoked with multiple tools at once.

- **Original:**

    ```ts
    notion install create-react-app latest
    notion install typescript 3.4
    ```

- **Updated:**

    ```
    notion install create-react-app@latest typescript@3.4
    ```

There are no impacts to features other than fetching, installing, and pinning.

## Implementation changes

The command line implementation will need to be updated, with the install, fetch, and pin commands now receiving a list of tool specs.

The command line parsing will need to be updated to accept variadic arguments of tool-with-optional-versions, using Clap's [`Arg::multiple`](https://docs.rs/clap/2.32.0/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.multiple) argument, with a custom parser. E.g., for `install`, we might have something like this

```rust
#[derive(StructOpt)]
pub(crate) struct Install {
    /// The tool to install, e.g. `node` or `npm` or `yarn`
    #[structopt(multiple = true), parse(try_from_str = "ToolSpec::try_from_str")]
    tools: Vec<ToolSpec>,
}
```

Here we assume that the `ToolSpec` will add a `try_from_str` or `try_from_os_str` implementation, with a useful error type—here hand-waved as `String`, but it could be as complex as we need as long as the error type has an implementation of `Into<String>`:

```rust
impl ToolSpec {
  fn try_from_str(string: &str) -> Result<ToolSpec, String> {
    // split apart the tool name and its version
  }
}
```

This is a relatively simple implementation. The only complication is the existence of Node namespaces: `@namespace/package`. This means parsing the version is not as simple as splitting on `"@"`. However, it should still be straightforward using the combination of a regular expression and the existing semver tooling.

The `ToolSpec` change will make the format `tool[@version]` work; updating the commands to take a `Vec<ToolSpec>` will support passing multiple arguments.

# Critique
[critique]: #critique

This introduces breaking changes—something which should not be done lightly! It does so under the assumption that fetching or especially installing or pinning multiple tools simultaneously is a relatively common operation. This assumption may be wrong. It may also be the case that implementing this—with the required changes to 

It also introduces a move away from users’ existing habits with `nvm` and `nodenv` and similar tools. This is thus an increase in the learning/switching costs for the tool.

*Not* doing this is not likely to be a blocker for wider adoption. The “problem” identified here represents a papercut, not a major pain point.

## Alternatives

-   Support *both* invocation styles. This may *just* be technically feasible, allowing users to pass any of the following invocations successfully:

    ```sh
    notion pin create-react-app
    notion pin create-react-app@3.0
    notion pin create-react-app 3.0
    notion pin create-react-app typescript
    notion pin create-react-app@3.0 typescript
    notion pin create-react-app typescript@3.4
    notion pin create-react-app@3.0 typescript@3.4
    ```

    However, this introduces substantial additional complexity for the implementation, and ambiguity around certain invocations, e.g. for tagged versions/special names. For example, how should the following invocation be resolved?
    
    ```sh
    notion pin create-react-app latest
    ```

    Does it refer to the latest version of `create-react-app`, or the default version of `create-react-app` and [the `latest` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/latest)? For all non-SemVer-string parses, this will be impossible to resolve.

    The proposed design here is well-proven with other tools which install more than simply a single tool-and-version pair, e.g. `npm`, `yarn`, and `cargo-edit`, and it does not fall prey to these problems of indeterminacy.

-   Leave things as they are. This has the upside of matching other Node version managers, all of which use a close variant on our current syntax.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- This will *suggest* to users that they can use tags, e.g. `tool@next`, a feature we do not currently support. Should we include support for that here, or plan it as follow-on work, or neither?
